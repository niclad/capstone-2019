# McKAHN ARM code
All the python files necessary to determine grip type for the McKahn Arm (WIP). To run any of the scripts in the repository, make sure you're using Python 3. (In terminal this can be done by running `$ python3 <file_name>.py`.)

All information about the code is below:

# Directories
Explanations of all the directories.

## Main
The files necessary to run *both* the emg classifier and the object recognition. Currently, the emg classifier does not work as intended, though the object recognition scipt does behave as expected.

## Misc
Miscellaneous files for the code. Only used to store files, because I feel like they'll be referenced in multiple directories.

## Myoband
Files for just emg classification. All the files work as expected.

## ObjectRecognition
There's one file and it doesn't classify anything. Idk.
